Last month, I was attacked by a drunk guy and ended up in the hospital with
brain bleeding.

All I could think about was the Stoic philosophy I had been reading
about that morning, and how lucky I was to get a chance to practice it.
The feeling of having my readings indicated was apparently enough to
outweigh the feeling that I might die.
