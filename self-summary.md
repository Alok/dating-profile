Getting assaulted just made me happy that I had more time to read without distraction in the hospital.

I went to the opera with cheap tickets and an expensive tuxedo. So during intermission, I flirted with a rich old lady and found myself sitting in the box seats. Which were uncomfortable. Worth $5000, my ass. At least I can check off 2 things from my bucket list.

I'm the only guy I know who owns 30+ pairs of shoes, bespoke clothes, and a tuxedo. I lent out my cufflinks to all the guys for high school prom.

I admire the Orthodox Celts for being one of the top bands in Serbia, despite exclusively performing Irish folk music. That's what I call success.

I learned all these for the sake of bets: computer science, math, Chinese, typing on a keyboard with blank keys, cooking.

I like asking strangers for criticism.

I once climbed a 50 foot cliff just to scare a couple making out underneath it. The look on their faces was priceless. The police officer's, not so much.

People say my sense of humor reminds them of Sterling Archer.

Most of my time is spent doing math, playing squash, talking to people I don't know about things I don't understand, helping people while aggressively refusing thanks, practicing Chinese, writing, or reading.
