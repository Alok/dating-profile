Doing something for the last time gives it a romantic air that makes it
sweeter than every other time. But everything you do has a last time. So
why not act as if every time is the last?

My date just smiled at me.

That night, I was attacked by a drunk guy and ended up in the hospital
for brain bleeding.

All I could think about was how lucky I was to have my belief tested,
and the sweet feeling of vindication, which apparently outweighed the
feeling that I might die.
