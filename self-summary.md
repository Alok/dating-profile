"You're a good person who tries very hard to hide it."

"Your mind is enough for me to have sex with you."

"Most of what he objected to the world at large was not the result of
people reading the wrong books, but rather of not reading any at all."

"Mathematics is a pleasant way to pass the time until the end. And to me
that makes it very serious, very important indeed."

"How are you not dead yet?"


I once got attacked by a drunk guy while I was on a date. I ended up in
the hospital with brain bleeding.

When the doctor told me that I might die, it disturbed me that I was
able to take the news with total equanimity. I *wanted* it to bug me
more than it did.

Being in the hospital was great in one way. I got to read even more
than I usually do, and I was getting through about 1500 pages a day. It
reminded me of Bertrand Russell describing his stint in prison.

When my dad asked me why wasn't worried, I said that I had done
everything I could to ensure that I would survive. So what was the point
of worrying? He said I was strange.


Every August, I go off somewhere because I feel the need to be in
motion. One year, I will go and get lost in Siberia.
