I'm studying mathematics, biology, and machine learning to work in
genomics.

The ultimate goal of this is to live and do math forever. I'm greedy. I
love life, and I want to experience as much of it as possible. Living
longer seems to be the easiest way to do that.

"Mathematics is a pleasant way to pass the time until the end. And to me
that makes it very serious, very important indeed."
