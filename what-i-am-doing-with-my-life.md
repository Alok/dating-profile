I'm studying mathematics, biology, and machine learning to work in biotechnology.

The ultimate goal of this is to live and do math forever. I'm greedy. I love life, and I want to experience as much of it as possible. Living longer seems to be the easiest way to do that.

<i>Mathematics is a pleasant way to pass the time until the end. And to me that makes it very serious, very important indeed.</i>
