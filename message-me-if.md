You use OkCupid to cast a wider net. Because you don't want to settle for the best person who just happens to walk past you.

You spend more time in your mind than anywhere elsewhere.

You'd rather have an interesting life than a content one.

You have a sarcastic, almost cruel sense of humor, but you're not a cruel person.

Part of you is still just as ambitious and passionate as you were when
you were a child, and you're proud of it.

You have major resting bitch face. For whatever reason, i find that extremely attractive.

<b>I have to be able to admire at least one thing about you.</b>
