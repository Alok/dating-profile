You use OkCupid to cast a wider net. Because you don't want to settle for the
best person who just happens to walk past you.

You spend more time in your mind than anywhere elsewhere.

You'd rather have an interesting life than a content one.

Part of you is still just as ambitious and passionate as you were when you were
a child, and you're proud of it.

<b>I have to be able to admire at least one thing about you.</b>
